### Description:
Participating in elections is extremely important, but for a first-time voter, it can seem more challenging than it really is. My first fullstack app, ‘What Is Voting Like?’ aims to solve that problem by having users complete a short training module that shows just how easy voting in person in the State of Tennessee can be. The training hits all the main points of what you experience when you show up to the polls, from when you first arrive, up until you grab your sticker on the way out. The training concludes with providing the user links to trusted sources to get accurate election information.

### How It Works:
‘What Is Voting Like?’ consists of components that create a linear training module that mirrors the experience of voting in person in Tennessee. After the user selects which training module they want take, a get request hits an endpoint created in C#, a query is run in the SQL database, and that data is returned and stored in props to be displayed on screen. Some components require user interaction, and once the component criteria is met, the Next button becomes active and allows the users to proceed.
